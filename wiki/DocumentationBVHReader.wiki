#Documentation for the source code

= Introduction =

This page is made to give a detailed overview of the functions used in the different classes and the variables used by the different classes for Developer use. The following classes will have their Documentataion hosted here

= Classes =

== [SubStructure] ==

// Class is made to store the joint information.
    // One may augment the class with additional information such as Bone Density, Bone Shape, Bone Length
    // Also when we integrate with PCL (Point Cloud Library), we may begin offering 3D visualization of the bones.

// Listed below are the variables used by this class. These variables encode all important information related to the joint.
    // Notes regarding variables used.
    // 1- name contains the name of the joint specified in the BVH file.
    // 2- offsetCoordinates contain variables stored in the following order X,Y,Z
    // 3- endsiteCoordinates contain variables stored in the following order X,Y,Z
    // 4- numberOfChannels corresponds to the amount of data given in each frame for this joint.
    // 5- parentIndex is the index of the parent SubStructure in the Structure array.

// Default constructor for the class.
// Everything is set to null or default value
{{{
SubStructure();
}}}

// User defined constructor for the class
// User has to specify all the class variables
{{{
SubStructure(std::string sName,std::vector<float> userOffsetCoordinates,std::vector<float> userEndsiteCoordinates,int sNumberOfChannels,int sIndexParent)
}}}

// Standard destructor for the class
// Clears all vectors
{{{
~SubStructure()
}}}
